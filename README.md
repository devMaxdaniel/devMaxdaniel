## About me

I'm Brazilian, currently a software engineering student, and aspiring in the technology field since 2015, during this time I worked on several personal projects, but only in 2022 did I decide to take this up as a profession, specifically as a **back-end.**

ðŸ‘¾ where I focused my work and study on the C# language and the .NET platform.

In my opinion, the best project ever to develop is always the next one. I love challenges, learning new skills and programming languages. I beleiebe that there is always spare to improve ourselves.
